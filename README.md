## Application Details
  
Currently, there are 5 default users made when the application is launched. It creates Name 0 PW0, Name 1 PW1, Name 2 PW2, etc. all the way up until Name 4. The first word is the username and the second word is the password. Moreover, Name 0 through Name 2 are set as 'user' user types and the rest are set as 'employer' user types. This means that the profile that is shown after clicking the profile button will be different for the two types of users.
